            <div class="heading">Soup</div>
            <p> No matter what season it is our soups are always in fashion. Today you can taste our golden and 
                revitalizing fennel walnut soup with apples, leeks, and turmeric. If you wonder the walnuts are 
                blended into the soup for an extra creamy texture and in the end this strong toasty walnut flavour 
                comes through with all of the leeks, fennel and lightly sweet apple and makes the whole thing a 
                touch creamier. And what makes our soup unique are our secret seasonings. Taste it right now!</p>

            <div class="heading">Dessert</div>
            <p>Lunch or dinner, the dessert is a key dish because if you don't try it, it is like you have left the
                table half hungry. So you don't want that and neither we do. That's why today we have prepared the 
                one and only Chocolate Pudding. It is plant-based and it carries some childhood memories. Moreover, 
                according to your taste you can choose which flavors to include in it. Some of these flavors are 
                raspberry, mint, orange and peanut butter. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do!</p>
